Analyze Node recursive copy ctor and assignment algorithms vs pre-order copy_tree. See `Time Complexity of Resursive Algorithms: The Master Theorem <https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/time-complexity-recursive-functions/>`_
and also https://adrianmejia.com/analysis-of-recursive-algorithms/.

This applies to bst, 2-3-4 and 2-3 trees.
